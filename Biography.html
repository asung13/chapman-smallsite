    <p>Jason Aldean is a country music singer and songwriter. He was born February 28, 1977 in Macon, Georgia with his birth name being Jason Aldine Williams. He was raised with his mom in Macon but would spend the summers with his dad in Homestead, Florida. It was during this time that his love for music began. Before his father would leave for work in the morning, he would map out guitar chords on a piece of notebook paper so that Jason could see where to place his fingers to play them. Jason would then spend all day practicing those cords, so that when his dad came home, they could play guitar together. Before long he could play a song after only hearing it a few times, leading his musical talents to continue to grow. At age 14 he began to perform on stage at his local VFW, talent competitions, and fairs, by 15 he had joined a house band at a Georgia bar. After high school Aldean and his band began performing at spots around the Southeast and Aldean began to write and record his own original songs. At the age of 21 he signed with Warner-Chappell song-publishing company and moved to Nashville in 1998. However, shortly after he was dropped by Warner-Chappel and another label in 2000. Eventually Aldean signed with Broken Bow Records, the label that he remains with today.
